## Design and Planning

### Brainstorming

From the beginning I wanted the end product to have somewhat of a personal link to myself or reflect my personality in a way. To do this I searched using pinterest for images that resonated with me to begin to form a picture of how the site would look. I wanted to spend a fair amount of time on this stage and the design / mock-up phase as a strong preparation would save myself time in the long run.

From this I noticed a theme of a natural rolling hills aesthetic as it reminded me of home. This coupled with an interest in both iconography and minimalism left me with a better idea for design and a solid foundation for the 'feel' of the site.

### Design

After seeing what I was drawn to on the image boards of pinterest I also began to think of a feature that might bring some life into my final design. Unfortunately this feature was not complete in time but gave me promise of future enhancements for the site.

The overall layout was made using figma and most of the process was spent in this stage.

Trello was used for documenting the process and keeping tabs on the remaining tasks needed for completion.
